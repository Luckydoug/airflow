# customers table only has field sales employee code.
e.g. 10379332 with sales employee code 291

on users, there are 3 users with se optom as 291

# views
doc entry 1005540 has other views for the same visit id 450105
docentry 1017699 " " " 45333 there is an earlier view 1015410 with order as well
doc entry 981676 """ 441643 there are many others e.g. with orders

On views, I have mapped the user sign field to the User Signature on Users.
Is this the way to do it?
