Hi Wairimu,

I have started looking into the above mentioned feedback:

Registrations - EyeTests/Orders
1. The exported data is missing 2472 registrations. The data consists of duplicated registrations. (Kindly see the attached file for your reference, "Missing Registration records")

Some registrations will be duplicated when customer has placed more than one order in the days specified in the filter.
e.g. for period June 1st to June 30th, cust_code 10369088 registered on 6/1/2022 and placed two orders 221002134,221002135
on 6/1/2022

I am currently working to resolve the missing registrations (will be done by EoD)

2. Canceled EyeTests

Removed all EyeTest with statuses Canceled  and CanceledEyeTest

3. The orders captured are for May, yet the registrations are for June.

Kindly provide an example for this. I have tried to recreate this but am getting order dates for June

Eye test - Orders
1) The orders are for the month of May yet the eye tests are for June

Kindly provide an example for this. I have tried to recreate this but am getting order dates for June

2) Some eye tests id (Test Code) consist of canceled eye tests. Remove any eye test with the status  "CanceledEyeTest" and
 "Cancel"
 
 Removed all EyeTest with statuses Canceled  and CanceledEyeTest

3) Missing eye test records

Working on the missing EyeTests (will be done by EoD)

Kindly see the attached file with different sheet names for reference. (Eye test - Order Check)

Some of the duplicates on EyeTests are also because if you look at the export, there is more than one order placed in the 
specified period after the date of the tests.
e.g. on custcode 10108995 Testcode 424121 orders 224503979 and 22111698


View RX - Orders
1) There exists missing records. Kindly see attached file (View RX Conversion Check)
Working on the missing Views (will be done by EoD)
2) Add the Eye test ID on the data that is exported.
Will add this by today (EoD)

NonView RX - Orders
## The export button is missing, kindly add it
Added the NoViewRX export in summary tab
